            <b>Step 2: Meet Your Underwater Crafting Buddy</b><br>
            Every great artist needs a muse. Yours might be a fish. Don’t be shy to say hello to your new finned friends – they might just inspire your first basket design.
            <br><br>
            <b>Step 3: Choose Your Seaweed Strands</b><br>
            We’ve got a colorful array of seaweed strands for you to choose from. Pick the ones that speak to your soul – or at least the ones that say, "Hey, I'd make a great basket!"
            <br><br>
            <b>Step 4: The Underwater Weaving Waltz</b><br>
            Now, let's get to weaving! Follow our instructor as they lead you through the mesmerizing dance of the underwater weaver. Breathe slowly, weave swiftly, and try not to tickle any passing fish.
            <br><br>
            <b>Step 5: The Art of Holding Your Breath (and Your Laughter)</b><br>
            Weaving underwater isn't just about craft; it's about poise. And occasionally not bursting into laughter when a curious octopus decides your basket is its new hat.
            <br><br>
            <b>Step 6: Basket Show-and-Tell with the Fish</b><br>
            Once your masterpiece is complete, it’s time to show it off. If you’re lucky, a school of fish might just swim by to admire your work. They’re the harshest critics, so brace yourself for some honest feedback.

            <b>Step 7: Surface with Your Creation</b><br>
            Time to head back to the surface. Emerging from the water with your basket is a moment of triumph – like a dolphin with a diploma. Take a moment to bask in the glory!
            <br><br>
            <b>Step 8: The Basket After-Party</b><br>
            Back on land, it’s time to celebrate with your fellow weavers. Share stories of your underwater escapades, show off your seaweed creation, and start planning your next dive.
            <br><br>
            <b>Step 9: Certificate of Bravery and Basketry</b><br>
            You did it! You braved the deep, danced with fish, and wove a basket to boot. Receive your well-deserved Certificate of Bravery and Basketry, complete with a seaweed ribbon.
            <br><br>
