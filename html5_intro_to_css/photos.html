            <h3>Outer Aesthetic</h3>
            <p>
                During the fabrication of my custom speaker, I prioritized both aesthetics and durability. I 3D printed the enclosure, following a meticulously
                crafted blueprint to ensure each component was created with precision. After printing, I used a robust adhesive to bond the pieces, resulting in a
                durable frame built to endure regular use. To enhance sound quality, I lined the speaker chambers with acoustic damping material, effectively
                minimizing undesirable resonances. Both the mid-driver and tweeter are enveloped by a layer of plaster of paris mixed with a plastic polymer,
                offering further resonance reduction. Post-assembly, I opted for a vinyl wrap for the exterior, granting both an added protective layer and a sleek,
                modern finish. I complemented this with wood veneer on the sides, which I sanded, stained, and clear-coated to introduce warmth and sophistication
                to the design.

            <h3>Internals</h3>
            <p>
                When it came to the internals of my custom speaker, I strategically placed all electronic components within a 3D printed enclosure on the back.
                Capitalizing on the accuracy and adaptability of 3D printing, I fashioned the enclosure to guarantee a snug fit for each component, maximizing
                their protection and performance. The rear placement ensured the front view remained clean and streamlined. Additionally, this orientation
                facilitated straightforward access to connection ports, simplifying tasks like setup, modifications, and troubleshooting, eliminating the need
                to disassemble the whole system. This blend of aesthetics and functionality meant that while the enclosure shielded the electronics, its placement
                also promoted a user-friendly experience. The culmination is a speaker system that's rich in sound quality and equally intuitive in design.
