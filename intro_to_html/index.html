    <h2 class="text_center">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Vinyl records are making a comeback. In the age of streaming, there's a growing group of people gravitating back to vinyl.
        They cite reasons like richer sound and the tactile experience of handling records.
        There's something about physically placing a needle on a record and seeing the large album art that digital just doesn't capture.
        And while digital music offers convenience, vinyl gives a sense of nostalgia and an authentic listening experience.
        See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/12/vinyl-sales-us-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Guardian article</a>
        for more information and statistics on the vinyl resurgence.
    </p>
    <p>It's interesting to see trends like this circle back. Many thought vinyl was dead with the rise of digital music, but today's consumers,
        especially the younger ones, seem to value the analog charm.
        The unique sound quality of vinyl, often described as "warm," is hard to replicate digitally.
        Record stores are popping up again, and artists are releasing on vinyl, showcasing its renewed importance in the music scene.
